Includes scripts and files created and used to perform the analyses mentioned in the project manuscript. Scripts were executed in MARBITS, the marine bioinformatics platform of the Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography at the Institut de Ci√®ncies del Mar (Marine Sciences Institute; ICM-CSIC), Barcelona.

This repository contains:

* The **Scripts** folder with all the Shell and R scripts used for the analyses, as well a file contaning the attributes from BBMO samples.
